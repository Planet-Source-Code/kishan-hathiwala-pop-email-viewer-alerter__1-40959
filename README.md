## POP Email Viewer & Alerter


</div>

### Description

This program checks the pop server provided by you at some regular interval of time and alert you when you have change in the no. of messages.

You have to provide pop mail server, port (if other than default port), username and of course password.

Returns the total no. of messages on the server and total bytes used by those mails messages

Uptill now i havent seen any side effects but if you find any then kindly let me know.

I have not used any API to access server but instead i have used some Low level commands to access POP server so basically you must know the use of the commands.

I have used some API like SetTimer, Shell_NotifyIcon, etc...
